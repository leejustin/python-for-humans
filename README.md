# Python for Humans

A minimalist website demonstrating key UI/UX principles through clean, visual examples. This site is designed to support presentations and educational content about design principles in code.

## Purpose

This website showcases 8 fundamental UI/UX principles with clear visual comparisons between good and bad examples. Each principle is demonstrated through interactive examples that are suitable for screenshots and live demonstrations.

## Principles Covered

1. **Scanning Patterns** - How users' eyes flow across the screen (Z-pattern)
2. **Labeling & Naming** - Clear, specific labels vs vague ones
3. **Visual Hierarchy** - Typography, spacing, and alignment
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Hiding complexity until needed
5. **Forms** - Clean forms with good defaults and guidance
6. **Design Systems** - Consistent, repeatable UI elements
7. **Simplicity** - Less is more in interface design
8. **Standardization** - Unified spacing, colors, and alignment

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Customizable icons

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Examples** - Toggle between good and bad examples
- **Clean Navigation** - Easy to navigate between principles
- **Screenshot-Friendly** - Designed for presentation use
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Lightweight and fast

## Design Philosophy

The site follows a minimalist design approach inspired by Notion:
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Lots of white space
- Soft borders and subtle shadows
- Neutral color palette
- Light hover effects
- No branding or logos

## Usage

Each page demonstrates a specific UI principle with:
- Clear explanations
- Visual examples
- Interactive toggles between good/bad examples
- Best practices and guidelines
- Comparison tables where applicable

## Customization

The site is built with modularity in mind:
- Each principle is its own page component
- Consistent styling through TailwindCSS classes
- Easy to add new principles or modify existing ones
- Reusable components for common patterns

## Screenshot Tips

- Use the toggle buttons to show both good and bad examples
- The site is optimized for screenshots with clean backgrounds
- Each principle page is self-contained and presentation-ready
- Consider using browser dev tools to adjust viewport size for different screenshots

## Contributing
